# SpringMVCFilmCRUD

## Overview
In short, this project took our recently completed film query command line application online. When the application is running, the user is presented with a menu of options. They can search the database for a film by id or keyword, add a film to the database, or edit a film from the database. Once an option is chosen, the user is taken down a path allowing them to complete the option chosen (search, add, edit). Once a film is located, edited, or added, it is displayed to the user. On the display screen, the user has the option to return to the homepage, edit a film or delete a film which is identified by its unique id.

## Technologies Used
Spring, Apache Tomcat, Amazon EC2, MySQL, Git, Terminal

## Lessons Learned
You reading this - brace yourself. This one's gonna be long. This project majorly advanced our understanding of the working relationship between jsp files, controllers, the DAO class, and Java objects. It made clear how to use the @RequestMapping tag. It solidified our understanding of how to use the ModelAndView class. It solidified our understanding of MySQL. We had a glaring and practical use for try/catch blocks, more than ever before. We wrote our most robust HTML code to date. On and on it the lessons can go, but we'll leave it here. Except one final lesson - the importance of attention to detail. We spent hours (with an s) throughout this project trying to identify bugs, and so often the issues were a single character like a plural or incorrect case.
